Everyone's path into cyber security is unique, with its own twists and turns. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving success in the field, especially when it comes to personal goals. In this post, I'll be sharing my personal journey on how I got started in cyber security.

## Ever since I was a kid

As a child, I never really considered a career in cyber security. That's not to say that the idea of being a hacker or spy from games like Deus Ex or movies like Spy Kids didn't appeal to me, but it wasn't something I actively thought about as a career option.

## Highschool days

Growing up, I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do as a career. However, I always had a strong interest in the sciences and mathematics, and enjoyed asking questions. This curiosity led me to explore different fields. Thanks to stereotypes and my Slavic background, I was often referred to as a "Russian nuclear physicist/hacker" in my primarily Canadian school. 

## Headed to Uni

It's true, I was fascinated by physics, so perhaps those stereotypes about me being a "Russian nuclear physicist/hacker" had some merit. In college, I ended up studing physics and focused on space and applied physics, with plans to pursue a PhD. However, I quickly learned that the traditional education system wasn't for me. Despite gaining valuable knowledge and skills in logical thinking and problem-solving, the structure of formal education was not something I enjoyed. Given the time commitment and uncertain job prospects in the field, I realized that a PhD was not the right path for me.
Instead, I turned my attention to computer science, which provided a faster route to a good paying job and offered a wider range of opportunities. It also allowed me to utilize my problem-solving skills and interest in technology. This choice also helped me to establish a better career opportunity, especially during the tough economy. Overall, it lead me into the field of cyber security, where i am now and loving it.

## The Switch

I decided to leave my physics program and made it my mission to graduate as quickly as possible, taking as many computer science courses as I could. I was determined to finish my education as fast as I could. This meant that I had to take on a heavy course load, including classes that conflicted with each other. It took a lot of time and effort to keep up with the work and get the grades I needed. But as I progressed through my studies, I began to specialize in a specific field, which is Cyber Security. I realized that the initial stereotype that people had of me as a "Russian nuclear physicist/hacker" had played a role in guiding my interest in this field. In a way, it helped drive me to learn more about Cyber Security as my specialization in Computer Science.

## Realizing my passion

After choosing my specialization in Cyber Security, I discovered that I had a real passion for the field. It was exciting to think about the potential to be a "badass hacker :D," and this motivated me to work harder than ever before. I graduated and continued to expand my knowledge in the field through external education and by participating in CTFs and utilizing different learning platforms, such as Udemy, YouTube, and other resources. All this extra education helped me to expose myself with CTFs, tools, and websites that are almost part of the journey of learning about cyber security. Overall, this experience opened my eyes to my passion and the importance of pursuing external education while in school. I will provide more information on my learning experience and course info in a later blog post.

## The Present 

This brings me to the present, where I have been continuously learning and educating myself about new trends and technologies in the field of cyber security. I have been studying and earning certifications to advance my career. Currently, I am working as a Cybersecurity Analyst for a startup. Overall, my journey into cyber security has been a challenging and fulfilling one, and I am excited to see where it takes me in the future.
