        <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This is a complex question. I will do my best to provide an answer, but keep in mind that this is my personal opinion and that the landscape is constantly changing. I hope that readers will be able to gain valuable information from my response and that I can guide you in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-lazy-">Dont be lazy :)</h2>
<p>Based on my previous articles, I may be biased as I have a formal education in cyber security from university. However, I have met many individuals over the years who have entered the field through completely different paths, not necessarily related to IT, security, or computer science. Everyone&rsquo;s life experiences put them in unique situations, and sometimes it can be difficult to change direction. Despite this, I firmly believe that with hard work and effort, anyone can achieve their goals. As cliche as it may sound, we are truly the masters of our own fate, steering the ship of our destiny. So, if you&rsquo;re interested in cyber security, don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Remember that this field is ever-expanding as technology grows and evolves, and companies will always need ways to protect themselves. That&rsquo;s where you come in!</p>
<h2 id="le-opinion">Le Opinion</h2>
<p>Ok, now on to my opinion. Personally, I do believe that you don&rsquo;t necessarily need a formal education in cyber security. However, simply talking about how much you like security won&rsquo;t get you anywhere. In this field, you will have to work hard, possibly harder than someone who did receive a formal education. But I can guarantee that the experience and self-knowledge you gain will pay off tenfold compared to a formal education from a university. Universities often have a lot of politics and philosophical teachings, which can be valuable in terms of ethics and other related topics, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty of hacking and doing CTFs, you may not get as much out of it unless you dedicate your own time. However, having a university degree does give you a &ldquo;paper&rdquo; that shows you have some knowledge which can make it easier to get into the field and streamlines the information you want to learn.</p>
<p>In the end, regardless of the route you take, you will likely be recommended or required to obtain specific certifications such as SEC+, CISSP, OSCP, etc. depending on the job. So, once you reach a specific position in your career, whether you have a formal education or not will become less important. Just remember, the goal is to work hard, don&rsquo;t be lazy, and spend the time to research what is worth your time and effort based on your own circumstances, and use that to make the best decision. When you push yourself to achieve, you will meet the right people and opportunities will start to manifest themselves.</p>
