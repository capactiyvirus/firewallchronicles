      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about many different tools that can be useful for CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions and other security-related activities. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on one of these tools: enum4linux and its successor, enum4linux-ng.&#xA;Both of these tools are designed to help with the enumeration of Windows and Samba systems, allowing security professionals and penetration testers to extract valuable information from SMB shares. Enum4linux has been a popular tool for many years, but the newer enum4linux-ng offers some improvements and additional features that make it a great option for those looking to perform more advanced enumeration.</description>

In light of this, I took the opportunity to create a plan for myself to further my education and improve my skills.</description>

      <description>Everyone&amp;rsquo;s path into cyber security is unique, with its own twists and turns. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving success in the field, especially when it comes to personal goals. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing my personal journey on how I got started in cyber security.&#xA;Ever since I was a kid As a child, I never really considered a career in cyber security. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that the idea of being a hacker or spy from games like Deus Ex or movies like Spy Kids didn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I actively thought about as a career option.</description>
