        <h2 id="building-credibility">Building Credibility</h2>
<p>Continuing on the topic of how to improve yourself and land that dream job, it&rsquo;s important to note that one of the key factors in standing out from other job applicants is effectively advertising yourself. A great way to do this is by creating a personal website where you can showcase your skills, experiences, and achievements in a unique and engaging way.</p>
<p>In the tech field, and specifically in cyber security, having a personal website can be especially beneficial. It gives potential employers a way to see your expertise and knowledge in the field, and can also demonstrate your ability to communicate complex technical concepts to a non-technical audience. It&rsquo;s also a great way to show off your personal brand and make yourself more memorable to hiring managers.</p>
<p>Creating a website can be an effective way to put yourself out there, differentiate yourself from other applicants, and increase your chances of landing your dream job. It&rsquo;s also a great way to demonstrate your skills and knowledge in the field, and to show that you are a proactive and forward-thinking professional.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-site">Creating a Site</h2>
<p>Creating a website can be a daunting task, especially if you have little or no experience in web development. Traditional web development involves writing code in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can be time-consuming and require a certain level of technical expertise. However, there are more modern and user-friendly options available today that make it easier to create a website without having to write code.</p>
<p>Website builders and Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress are popular choices for people who want to create a website without having to write code. They provide pre-built templates and drag-and-drop interfaces that make it easy to design and manage a website.</p>
<p>Another option is JAMstack, which stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. JAMstack allows you to create fast and secure websites using modern web development technologies like React, Angular, Gatsby, etc. With JAMstack, you can develop a website quickly and easily by using pre-built components and APIs, rather than having to write everything from scratch.</p>
<p>In short, creating a website doesn&rsquo;t have to be a daunting task; with the right tools and resources, you can have your website up and running in no time.</p>
<p>The process of setting up a website can vary depending on the method you choose. Here is a general overview of the steps involved in setting up a website:</p>
